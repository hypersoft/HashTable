HashTable

Breakfast is served.

[WikiPedia Description of Hash Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

In computing, a hash table (also hash map) is a data structure used to implement
an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses
a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from
which the correct value can be found.

This library written in 100% C is an implementation of hash table featuring
separate chaining with linked lists. It supports binary keys, and binary data.
Convenience procedures are provided to facilitate common key profiles such as:

*  UTF8 String (ANSI C String)
*  Integer
*  Double
